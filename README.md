# LED Cube
I need to program an asteroids game on 8x8x8 LED Cube with STM32 Micro-controller on Nucleo-64 board
My task is: There is a crosshair on the lowest level of the cube, which can be moved by means of tactile inputs. 
Blocks fall down and can be shot down.
The falling blocks have different sizes and colors which are randomly determined.
There are up to three blocks in the cube at the same time. Blocks can only be shot down if the colors match.
